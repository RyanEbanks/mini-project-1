## Description
This is my first project with Rutgers full-stack web development bootcamp. The aim of this project is to assess my ability to refactor existing code to the horiseon website to make it more accessible which is a common task for front-end and junior developers.

## Installation
N/A

## Usage
This project will be used to solidify how to format both HTML and CSS using the proper semantic guidelines. This allows the code to be more readable both for you and any other developer you are working with. In addition this project is used to display the changes made to make a website more accessible to the user.
